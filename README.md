# Social-Network-API

## Description
The goal of this project is to byild an API for a social network web app where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses  [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for routing, a MongoDB database, and the [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) ODM. Sadly this app is not deployed so there is a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the backend server.

## Install
Download the file from my github and install Insomnia!

THEN you server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN you open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
