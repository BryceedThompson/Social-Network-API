# Social-Network-API

## Description
The goal of this project is to build an API for a social network web app where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses  [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for routing, a MongoDB database, and the [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) ODM. Sadly this app is not deployed so there is a walkthrough video that demonstrates the functionality of the backend server.

## Install
Download the file from my github and install Insomnia!
* [Github Link](https://github.com/BryceedThompson/Employee-Tracker)
* [Insomina download Link](https://insomnia.rest/download)

## Usage
* Open your terminal in the server.js file.
* Run the command 'npm i' 
* After download is finished enter 'npm run start'
* The server is now running you can now interact with it through the Insomnia app
* Checkout the walk through video for routes and interactions
```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN you enter the command to invoke the application
THEN you server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
WHEN you open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN you test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN you am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN you test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN you am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
